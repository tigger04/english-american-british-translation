	•	The opening sets a contemplative mood, with the grey sea symbolizing Sarah’s sadness and the passage of time since Mike’s death. The small detail of comparing the sea to her aquamarine engagement ring is a lovely touch that links setting and memory.
	•	The story effectively uses flashbacks to show how Sarah met Mike, what he meant to her, and how their bond grew through shared interests (hiking, swimming). These memories weave in naturally, grounding the emotional core.
	•	The repeated references to tuna sandwiches and the flask of tea give a cozy, everyday feel. They show the small routines that keep Mike’s presence alive for Sarah.
	•	The seat up high, overlooking the sea, becomes a strong focal point for remembrance. It’s a tangible place holding all their shared moments, making it clear why she keeps returning.
	•	Dialogue between Sarah and her friend Una serves to reveal backstory (how Sarah was introduced to Mike) without feeling like an info-dump. It also shows how supportive Una is.
	•	The memory of learning to swim echoes nicely with the idea of “letting go” – both literally (floating) and emotionally (releasing grief). It’s a strong metaphor tying into the title.
	•	The tension between Sarah’s joy at finding love again and the tragic loss that follows underlines the fragility of life. The final, understated goodbye is poignant.
	•	You could expand the moment of realization when Sarah learns of Mike’s disappearance. The phone call scene could be more detailed, showing her immediate emotional reaction and the shock she experiences. This would deepen the impact of the tragedy.
	•	Some paragraphs jump between flashback and present time quickly. A bit more signposting or transitional language might help readers follow each shift.
	•	The story might benefit from slightly more interiority in the present scenes. Sarah is clearly grieving, but letting us further into her present emotional state (e.g., her physical sensations, her breath catching, her heart pounding) can heighten the sense of loss and longing.
	•	Although Una’s supportive nature comes through, a small scene showing Sarah and Una in the present (rather than just remembering past phone calls) could emphasize how Sarah’s friendships help her cope.
	•	Consider giving a bit of detail about Mike’s perspective or personality, perhaps from Sarah’s memories—little quirks, how he reacted to good/bad news—so that readers feel more of his specific presence before he’s gone.
	•	The ending is understated and solemn, which works, but adding a short reflective line about Sarah’s next step or a slight gesture of closure (e.g., scattering something on the water, standing up and turning away) might give the final goodbye even more resonance.
