#+TITLE: eng: British-American English converter (CLI)

Eng is a CLI tool to translate from American to British English and vice versa.

+ For Python it fixes only string literals, docstrings, and comments.
+ For other programming languages it fixes only string literals.
+ For plain text files it fixes all words.

* FORK - Rationale
Why did I fork this? As u/moononthebones put it so succinctly on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/xlzyi1/eng_translate_british_english_into_american/][reddit]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*u/moononthebones*
A lot of these American spellings are also valid British English spellings: Oxford spelling style (preferred by most scientific publications) uses ‘-ize’ endings, so ‘acclimatize’ is a correct British variant. Whereas British English will always use ‘analyse’ rather than ‘analyze’.
#+END_QUOTE

Oh, and I also changed the readme from Markdown (yuk) to orgmode (yay).
